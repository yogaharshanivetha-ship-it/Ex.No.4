### Explanation - Any one use case from Unit 5 and write the prompt for that with the unit 2 Prompt types given above.

Procedure:
1.	Define the Scenario and Use Case:
Scenario:
The manufacturing industry is looking to reduce manual monitoring and increase efficiency through automation. The system will utilize IoT devices and embedded controllers to automate equipment, monitor performance, and enable predictive maintenance. The goal is to streamline the production process, minimize downtime, and enhance energy efficiency.
Target Audience:
Manufacturing companies, specifically in sectors like automotive, electronics, and food processing, where automation can significantly improve productivity.

Main Objectives:

•	Improve production efficiency by 30%.
•	Minimize machinery downtime with predictive maintenance.
•	Enable real-time monitoring and remote control of manufacturing systems.
•	Reduce energy consumption by optimizing processes.
 
2.	Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect:
Idea Generation Prompts:

Comparative Analysis Prompt
Definition: Asking for a comparison between two or more concepts, often highlighting similarities and differences.
•	"Compare and contrast deep learning and machine learning."
•	"How do renewable and non-renewable energy sources differ?"

Experiential Perspective Prompt:
> 	“As a software engineer, what are the benefits of using cloud computing in your projects?”
>  “From a student’s perspective, describe the challenges of online learning.”

Everyday Functioning Prompts:
*	  “Describe the role of machine learning in everyday apps like YouTube or Netflix."
*	 	“How is encryption used in daily life when sending WhatsApp messages?”

Universal Prompt Structures:
^ 	“Explain [concept] in simple terms with an example.”
^  “Explain the process of [task] step by step.”

Prompt Size Limitations:
&  	“Translate this 5000-word essay into Tamil.”
→ Manageable chunks: “Translate the first 1000 words into Tamil, then continue.”
&  “Give me 50 examples of AI applications.”
→ Adjust for size: “Give me 10 AI applications at a time.”
